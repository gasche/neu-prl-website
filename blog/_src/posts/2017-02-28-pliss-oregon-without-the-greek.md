What does every student interested in programming languages need to
learn about the practical side of the field? That is the question that
the first international summer school on programming language
implementation (or [PLISS](https://pliss2017.github.io) for short) has
set out to answer.

<!-- more -->

The school will feature [twelves
speakers](https://pliss2017.github.io/speakers.html) versed in
programming language practicae ranging from abstract interpretation to
garbage collection and from compiler implementation to language
design. The lectures will feature hands on exercises as well as lesson
learned from large scale industrial efforts.

Lectures cover current research and future trends in programming
language design and implementation, including:

- Writing Just-in-time Compilers with LLVM
- Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking
- Designing a Commercial Actor Language
- High-Performance Fully Concurrent Garbage Collection
- Compiling Dynamic Languages
- Language-support for Distributed Datastores
- Testing Programming Language Implementations
- Abstract Interpretation and Static Analysis

A summer school is also an opportunity to get know the speakers and
get ideas for research problems. Students will have the opportunity to
socialize with a peer group of other students in PL as well as
professors and industrial researchers.

Thanks to generous funding from NSF, ONR and SIGPLAN, costs will be
kept low and some fellowships are available to cover travel costs.
